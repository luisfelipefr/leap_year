# LOGICAL OPERATORS

Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.

Write a leap_year.cpp program that:

1. Takes a year as input.
2. Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
3. Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
   
There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:

   * If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…
   * If that year can be evenly divided by 100, and it is not evenly divided by 400, then it is NOT a leap year.
   * If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

-Take some time to research and brainstorm before starting to write the code!
